# `rail_data.models` â€” Overview

The **models** sub-package assembles feature tables into modelling frames,
fits statistical or machine-learning models, and supports Monte Carlo
simulation of incident counts and severities.

## Quick start

```python
from rail_data.models.simulation import simulate_glm_counts

# Merge feature tables for a single track segment
frame = build_modelling_frame(elr_mil="A1231")

# Fit models for the first available segment
# Fit a statistical model on the first available segment
result = train_first_elr_model()

# Draw incident-count trajectories via Monte Carlo
X = frame.drop(columns=[c for c in frame.columns if c.startswith("INCIDENT_")])
counts = simulate_glm_counts(result, X)
```
